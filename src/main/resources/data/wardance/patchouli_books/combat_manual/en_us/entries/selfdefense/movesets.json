This is usually a set distance, and weapons with extended reach can still directly strike the foes even outside the defined circle. $(br2)$(l)None$() is simply no sweeping is present, it only hits under your cursor."

Combo your different swings for different purposes based on the weapon for more dynamic combat. Becoming blinded will also nullify the ability to sweep while it exists leaving you at quite the disadvantage."
