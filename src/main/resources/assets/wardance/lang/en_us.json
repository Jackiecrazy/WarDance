Players holding properly registered weapons or shields will automatically parry attacks from the front if the weapon is not cooling down resulting in an audible anvil clang noise. These attacks have their damage negated, but still deal posture damage, allowing you to skillfully negate hits. Mobs holding weapons can also parry.

  "wardance.skill.knockdown.desc": "A stun that is the result of a hit of heavy posture damage or from good use of skills.

After a certain point, if you can reach it (around 1.18 effectiveness), this balance actually tips in favor of dealing more damage instead of less, turning you into a sort of paradoxically non-lethal glass cannon fighter.
